# C++ course Deep Dive in C++
This repository contains the exercises and final project of the C++ course I have finished. My certificate is also available in PDF.

### compilation
I have added a makefile, so if you have `g++` and `make` installed, you can simply clone this repository, enter it, and type `make`. Otherwise, compile each `.cpp` file separately.
